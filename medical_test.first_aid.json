Since mosquitoes are night feeders, stay away from danger zones – particularly fields, forests and swamps – from dusk to dawn to avoid being bitten. Wear pants and long-sleeved clothing that are light-colored and comfortable as mosquitoes can bite through tight synthetic clothing and are attracted to dark colors.",
